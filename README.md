- Identify key factors influencing **Loan Status**.
- Provide data-driven business recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights
- Applicants with **steady employment** and **low debt** are less likely to default.
- **Short credit history** and **high debt-to-income ratio** are strong risk indicators.
- Income verification plays a major role in reducing loan defaults.
